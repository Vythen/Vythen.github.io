    <!-- The layout that has been chosen is for: Akira Vol 1 - page 167
        the purpose for this was that I found the way of breaking down the layout
        using snipping tool to be intuitive. I also appreciated the conversation 
        occuring between the two characters, as this would allow me creative expression
        between the colour choices.-->

    <!-- For this style code, the border radius has been established across the grid to emulate the 
        aesthetical style of the Manga panel. I found that in reading Manga, it presents a certain level
        of boldness around each image, this causes the users gaze to gravitate towards the images
        while providing a sense of immersion through definining those points of focus. By utilising a 
        basic white border with minor curves, it can allow for the colour selection, and hover function, 
        to be the highlight of the page, while allowing the borders for the panels to feel bolder
        akin to the Manga panels style.-->

<!-- For the layout, I utilised a grid format, with div classes named in subsequent order for which for each panel the user will read.
    Additionally, this assists me in keeping track of what image needs to go where.-->
