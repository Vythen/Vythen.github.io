  <!-- For the code, we undertook a significant overhaul. As I was experimenting with the originally provided code, I found 
       frequent challenges in making the accurate time being depicted clealy balance out with the progress bar. This lead to 
       me reading several online tutorials to see if I could develop a better solution that would be far more aesthetically 
       pleasing than the original layout. I wanted to keep in-tact all the original buttons, while providing room for future 
       features that could be added. An example of this is in the options right list, which serves to also assist in providing
       breathing room for the left and center lists of the video player.-->
